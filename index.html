<H2> Competition Event </H2>

<p>The intent of the Competition Event is to bring a level of fun to
the rocketry community, while encouraging innovation using new and
emerging technologies. Tripoli encourages all members to participate
in the Competition Event which is intended to recognize the
achievements of Tripoli members who succeed in attaining difficult
goals. </p>

<p>In recognition of those who push the envelope, the Tripoli Records
committee maintains a Top-10 database for all fliers within each
category below.<p>

<p>Tripoli launch organizers are encouraged to hold competition events
at their launches. Individuals may participate in these events at
Tripoli launches, or attempt to set the record for the event on their
own when no competition event has been scheduled during a launch.</p>
