<H3>Tripoli Competition Events  (Amended August 2021) </H3>

This document describes the competition rules, procedures and
categories of competition. All TRA Prefects and TAP members are
encouraged to fully understand these for implementation at their
launches. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The following competition categories
are approved for Tripoli high power launches. Tripoli launch
organizers are encouraged to hold these competition events at their
launches. Individuals may participate in these events when they are
held at these Tripoli launches, or attempt to set the record for the
event on their own when no competition event has been scheduled for
the launch. The Tripoli Contest and Records Committee will maintain
records in the Hall of Fame for each event in the categories
indicated. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />1.1 <strong>Safety is of primary
importance.</strong> TRA and Prefects and TAP members request that
launch competitors, competitor&rsquo;s assistants, RSO&rsquo;s and
LCO&rsquo;s take all precautions to prevent any accident or injury to
TRA members, launch spectators, and other competitors. The TRA safety
code must be followed as applicable. This includes landing within the
waiver cylinder.<br />&nbsp;<br />1.2 Tripoli awards records for
flights made less than 30,000 feet MSL based on flyer-supplied
barometric flight computers. All flights anticipated of achieving
records &nbsp;30,000 MSL and over are to use flyer-supplied,
TRA-approved GPS units for altitude verification. &nbsp;See

Violation of the rules and disputes-
&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>1.3.1 Violation
of these rules will lead to disqualification of the
entry.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>1.3.2
Violation of the applicable TRA safety code or TRA Research Safety
Code will lead to disqualification of the entry.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
1.3.3 Decisions of the TRA Competition Committee are final and cannot
be brought before the TRA BOD or other TRA body.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
1.3.4 The deliberations of the TRA Competition Committee are
confidential.&nbsp;</p> <strong>2.0 Rules and
procedures&nbsp;</strong> <p>2.0.1 Flights less than 30,000 feet MSL:
TRA flyers may use any commercially manufactured, barometer based
altimeter for their flights. No modifications to these commercially
manufactured units are allowed. Optionally, a TRA-approved GPS unit
may be used. </p> 2.0.2 Flights to 30,000 feet MSL and over: TRA
flyers are required to use a TRA approved GPS unit (as listed on the
TRA website) to generate altitude data. See section 3 below for more
details.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><p>2.1 Each contestant must submit a
TRA Records Application form to the launch Prefect or TAP member,
either prior to launch or at launch, and announce to Prefect or TAP
member their intent to launch along with any requirements. The Prefect
or TAP member must insure contestant satisfies proper TRA safety rules
including RSO approval of rocket and proper launch distance
conformance. The flyer is encouraged to have the flight announced as a
TRA record attempt. &nbsp;</p> &nbsp;<br />2.2 After the flight, flyer
must return their rocket to Prefect for inspection to validate
conformance to TRA rules per section 2.8 below. The rocket must be
recovered.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><p>2.3 The record application form
must be signed, on the same day as the flight, by the flyer and the
launch Prefect or TAP member witnessing the maximum altitude as read
from the altimeter or GPS unit. If the rocket is not recovered on the
same day, the Records committee may, at its discretion, approve the
flight. Backdating of record applications is not permitted.&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;<br />2.4 Along with application, flyer is required to submit
pictures of rocket and of themselves. Pictures can be &nbsp;e-mailed
to the TRA Committee should a record be set. Flyers are encouraged to
take the pictures at launch site. &nbsp;&nbsp; <div><br />2.5 Should a
new highest altitude be set in a category, or certified as within 10%
of the highest in that category, the flyer will be notified. Their
flight will be posted on the TRA Hall of Fame web page along with
flight information, pictures, and graphs of altimeter
data.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2.6 For events which are based on total
impulse, the motor class will be determined by the total impulse of
all motor(s) as tested and not the manufacturer's designation or
estimated total impulse.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2.7 Only certified
motors may be used to set Tripoli Records and the total impulse of all
motors must not exceed 40,960 newton-seconds. (Research motor
competitions shall include motors up to and including Q designations)
&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2.8 For every event, rockets must successfully
deploy their recovery device(s) and have a safe descent. The same
standards used in certification flights shall apply to Tripoli
Records. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2.9 No modification to certified
motor hardware is allowed. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2.10 All rockets
must be launched without any &ldquo;boost assist&rdquo; of sabot
tubes, air pressure, external forces, &nbsp;propellant not part of the
rocket, or any other method other than the energy generated directly
from the rocket motors used. Launch rails, rods, guides and towers are
allowed.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>3.0 Rules and procedures for GPS
Based Flights</strong><br />3.1 Rockets expected to achieve altitudes
of 30,000 MSL and above are required to contain a flyer-supplied GPS
unit approved by TRA, (as listed on the TRA website ) to generate
altitude data. This data must be recorded and sent to the TRA
Competition committee for review and
validation. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />3.2 Flyers are required to submit
the GPS data file as recorded on the in-flight GPS unit for review and
validation. Down-linked radio data (i.e. packet radio data) is not
sufficient.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />3.3 Flyers are required to submit
any recorded barometer and accelerometer flight computer data along
with the GPS data file for the flight.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />3.4
Should the GPS fail to record some fixes, no interpolation will be
allowed. Only physical data logged can be
used.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;All data will be posted on the TRA
website should a new Hall of Fame flight be
attained.<br /><br /><strong>4.0 Requirements for setting a Tripoli
Record (in addition to the above)&nbsp;</strong><br />A. Tripoli
Competition Record form must be completed and signed by the flyer and
the launch Prefect or TAP member witnessing the altitude
data&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />B. A clear photograph of the rocket and
the flyer in JPEG. Pictures should be e-mailed to the TRA records
committee administrator for posting on the TRA
site.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />C. Send all of the above to the Contest
and Records Committee within 30 days of the
flight&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />D. Flights certified as new maximum
altitude or certified to be within 10% of the existing highest
altitude for that class will be posted on the TRA website with flight
information, pictures, and graphs of altimeter
data.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />E. Only one record application can be completed per flight. &nbsp;<br /><br /><p>
<strong>5.0 Altitude Competition - single motor configuration&nbsp;</strong><br />Only rockets using single motors are permitted under this category. No staged or clustered flights permitted in this

newton-seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>I</td> <td>320.01</td> <td>to</td> <td>640
newton-seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>J&nbsp;</td> <td>640.01</td> <td>to</td> <td>1280
newton-seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>K</td> <td>1280.01</td> <td>to</td> <td>2560
newton-seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>L</td> <td>2560.01</td> <td>to</td> <td>5120
newton-seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>M&nbsp;</td> <td>5120.01</td> <td>to</td> <td>10240
newton-seconds</td> </tr> <tr> <td>N</td> <td>10240.01</td> <td>to</td> <td>20480
newton-seconds</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;<br />The purpose
of the hybrid competition is to obtain the greatest altitude possible
for a given total impulse. The event is open to all rockets using
Tripoli certified motors. The motor class will be determined based on
the total impulse of all motor(s) as tested.&nbsp;<br />This current
hybrid category allows single motor configurations, clusters and
staging. All flights to within 10% of the highest altitude for that
class will be posted.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>7.0 Handicapped
Rocket Category&nbsp;</strong><br />The purpose of the handicapped
rocket altitude competition is to achieve the greatest possible
altitudes when there are restrictions on both the total impulse used
and the minimum rocket diameter and length. This event should also
appeal to those who fly on limited sized fields and allow a large
number of rockets flown at typical launches which are not minimum
diameter to be competitive. By restricting both the total impulse and
diameter of a rocket, the emphasis must be shifted towards modifying
weight, drag, and design to increase
altitude.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The intent is to allow as many
rockets as possible to participate in the event. The minimum length
ensures that rockets with transitions, boat tails and multiple
diameters may participate provided they have the required minimum
diameter for the specified length.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />7.1 The
classes have been chosen to reflect industry standard tubing
sizes. They are slightly below the standard diameters and have been
rounded down to the nearest quarter of an inch. Note: the diameter
listed is the minimum diameter, not the maximum
diameter.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />G Class -- Minimum diameter of 2.50
inches for at least 2 feet&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Maximum total
impulse of 160.00 newton-seconds for G.<br />&nbsp;<br />H &amp; I
Class -- Minimum diameter of 3.75 inches for at least 3
feet&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Maximum total impulse of 320.00
newton-seconds for H.<br />&nbsp;<br />J &amp; K Class -- Minimum
diameter of 5.00 inches for at least 5 feet&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
Maximum total impulse of 1280.00 newton-seconds for J; 2560.00 maximum
newton-seconds for K.<br />&nbsp;<br />L &amp; M Class --
&nbsp;Minimum Diameter of 7.5 inches for at least 8 feet. Maximum
total impulse of &nbsp;5120.00 newton-seconds for L; &nbsp;10,260
newton-seconds for M..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />N &amp; O Class --
Minimum diameter of 11.5 inches for at least 12 feet. Maximum total
impulse of 20,480 newton-seconds for N; 40,960 newton seconds for
O.<br />&nbsp;<br />If a multistage rocket is used, then the uppermost
stage must conform to the above diameter and length restrictions. This
does not exclude the use of multistage rockets, but does not provide
them with an advantage over single stage
rockets.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Record Information: Each motor class
has the diameter restrictions as listed above. While unlikely to
occur, rockets that set a large rocket altitude record are eligible to
set an open altitude record. All flights to within 10% of the highest
altitude for that class will be posted.<br /><br /><strong>8.0
